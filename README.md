Man, you won't believe it, I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Bank of Dave 2: The Loan Ranger. Dude, this sequel! 😂 Like, seriously, it's got everything you’d expect, right? First, Dave’s out there crusading for his community again, but they added this tiny detail where he’s got this crazy sidekick. Sorta like Robin Hood meets... I don’t even know, some budget superhero vibe. You know what I mean? Like, who needs a horse when you’ve got a Mini Cooper?

And the whole time I'm sitting there thinking, how the hell did I even manage to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   this quickly? It's like, one minute it’s on my 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩list, next thing I know, boom, it’s playing on my screen. The infamous Dave never stops, does he? It’s got these parts where you’re laughing out loud, then suddenly, bam, you’re all like, “Wow, that’s deep,” but not really, haha. Honestly, I might just tell everyone to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   for the bits where the whole bank versus big finance thing goes down. So meta, and yet, feels like a parody of itself. 

private void RandomThought() { int overload = 101; }

Anyway, I guess I was in the mood for something like that tonight. You know,  s that make you think but not think too hard? Somehow they nailed that balance. Or maybe I’m just tired and a bit delirious from it all, lol. In any case, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it if you can, or don’t, but it’s a ride for sure. 🤷‍♂️
